# Simple Project: Drum learning app

This a project for making a learning app for drum students. It is situated in its very beginnings.

At the moment you can load the Python script *interactive.py* and you'll get in a loop where you can
- record audio (via PortAudio)
- play this back (via PortAudio)
- time-stretch it (simple, pitch-changing, by just interpolating the audio signal)
- writing it to hard disk

## Dependencies
At the moment you need
- Python (http://www.python.org/)
- PyAudio (http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
- NumPy/SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/)
